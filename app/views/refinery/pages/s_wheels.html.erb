The front wheel has 12 blade shaped spokes for better aerodynamics while the rear wheel has 12 conical shaped spokes for increased stiffness. Each wheel is supplied with a titanium skewer with a carbon lever displaying the CORIMA logo. 8 different wheel decal colours are available in order to match your MCC “S+” wheels to your frame color.</p>
