        <p>The “S+” wheels combine lightness and beauty ! The “S+” wheels are available in 32 mm and 47 mm in tubular or clincher versions. They are built with the very light carbon “S+” hubs on which the CORIMA logo is engraved. The front wheel has 18 black CX-Ray “straight-pull” spokes and the rear wheel has 20 CX/CX-Ray. Each wheel is supplied with a titanium skewer with a carbon lever displaying the CORIMA logo. 8 different wheel decal colors are available in order to match your “S+” wheels to your frame color.</p>
