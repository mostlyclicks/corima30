25 YEARS OF SUCCESS IN CYCLING
CORIMA S.A. was founded in 1973 by Mr Pierre MARTIN and Mr Jean-Marie RIFFARD and is based in Loriol sur Drôme (26) in France. The word CORIMA is taken from COoperation RIffard MArtin.

Its initial activities were mechanical moulding – the manufacturing of molds and models for the foundry, automobile and aeronautics industries.

In 1988, CORIMA diversified into the production of carbon composite parts and launched its first product for the cycling industry – the “Disc Wheel”. This was followed by many other products and has been successful in creating a full range of carbon products for cycling.

CORIMA has always worked with cycling professionals on both the track and road racing circuits. Our products have been involved in many prestigious victories and setting of new records around the world and continue to do so with numerous athletes.
